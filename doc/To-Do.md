# To-Do

-[ ] Use filenames to match tracks when rerendering (instead of title/artist).
-[ ] Fix path extraction on macOS.
-[x] Retain metadata from existing Traktor collection.
-[x] Merge playlists with existing Traktor playlists.
-[ ] Selectively overwrite metadata or only cues.
-[ ] Automatically backup a target file when overwriting it.
-[ ] Support different origin/destination paths.
-[ ] Fix key representation in files: Traktor doesn't understand "Gmin/Gmaj", but "Gm/G".
-[-] Merge playlists, update ones coming from RB (use UUID as identifier: hash the name).
-[x] Rounding errors when exporting cues? they seem off by a bit in Traktor.
-[x] Convert memcues to a different type of traktor cue.
-[x] Rounding errors in exported loop lengths.

# To-Do

- [x] retain metadata from existing Traktor collection
- [x] merge playlists with existing Traktor playlists
- [ ] selectively overwrite metadata or only cues
- [ ] automatically backup a target file when overwriting it
- [ ] support different origin/destination paths
- [ ] fix key representation in files: Traktor doesn't understand "Gmin/Gmaj", but "Gm/G"
- [-] merge playlists, update ones coming from RB (use UUID as identifier: hash the name)
- [x] rounding errors when exporting cues? they seem off by a bit in Traktor
- [ ] convert memcues to a different type of traktor cue
